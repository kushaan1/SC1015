    "2. **ANOVA test:** It is improbable to use linear regression models that we have used earlier in this course to create plots for categorical variables, hence we did one-hot encoding, as mentioned earlier. We also performed the ANOVA test to confirm that there are statistically significant differences between the mean prices of different brands and different processor brands.\n",
    "3. **Random Forest Regressor:** Returns the feature importance of each variable by comparing elements within the variable, to see which variable affects the dependent variable (price) the most.\n",
    "4. **Clustering:** Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** and **Silohuette Score**. We initialise the KMeans algorithm with optimal number of clusters and fit it to the preprocessed data toobtain cluster assignments for each data point. After adding the cluster assignments to the DataFrame, we visualise the relationship between variables, segmented by clusters.\n"

    "### 5. Predictive Analysis and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the variable that affects the price of laptops the most to try and predict the cost of the laptops and see whether it is accurate. After which, we decided to analyse deeper into our project by using Scatter plots to see if a highly priced laptop does have a high rating, and vice versa. We found an overarching general pattern - the higher the price of the laptop, the higher its rating. However, there was an obvious anomaly, the highest priced laptop brand actually had the lowest mean rating. We thus concluded that **\"the higher the price of the laptop, the higher the rating\"** would **NOT** always be true, and suggested two brands that users can consider due to their relatively lower price and the fact that they had the highest ratin."
